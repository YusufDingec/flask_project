# flask_project
A recording system API that is functional and ready to use, as someone who requests a username and password from the user, saves it to the database and does not enter the password correctly, cannot delete himself from the system.
For example, if you want to keep the user information in a library, you can use this site by directing the student, so you can borrow the book they want and watch the date taken from the database.

-Furthermore, I wanted to create a more effective and secure deploy environment with containerization process using docker for this project.
